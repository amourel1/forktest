<p>Welcome to James Keller's amazing ctf challenge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>Scenario: I am hiding this website and its files from webcrawlers, I would hate for it to index my website and files so I left them some instructions in a text file, can you find that file? </p>
<p> base 10 number systems are pretty cool huh? </p>
<p> the answer will look like this: "flag{xxxxxxxxx}" </p>
